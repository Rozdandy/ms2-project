Climate Change Memory Game is pratically educative site, it is for those that care about the health of the planet earth. The goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive site which is user friendly to everyone in all ages and profession. The homepage provide an educating information on climate change which include some notable quotes of leaders across the world. While the game section is a memory game using cards whereby users are to match pairs. The cards are embossed with intriguing climate change related items and terms such as, GHG green house gases molecules, climate change impact, and mitigations pictures. Users will use their memory and skill to match the pairs before the time finishes.

## Design Choices

The concept behind this site was borne from my love for the planet, on how better human can treat her so that this generation can bequeath her to the next generation. Also, the idea of building the game was inspired by a Youtube video [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ) that I watched on how a Halloween card was built.  I therefore, thought of how to sensitize audience on climate change impact, mitigation and adaptation while at the same having fun.
I supposed the concept would be good for a memory games partly due to different images, colors and above all the subconcious learning part of it. I wanted a game site that will be highly interactive with quiet and less distractive music to go with the game.


#### Fonts

[Google Fonts!](https://fonts.google.com/) Two main fonts were used for the whole sites:

* Supermercado for the body with fall back on san serif.
* Langar for the headers with with fall back on san serif.

#### **Colour Scheme**

The developer used [eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/shades-of-green-color) to choose colors that were used in creating the website. Particularly, 5 colors were used and they signify what the sites stands for.
  * RGBArgba(90, 150, 210, 0.95): this is a shade of light-blue which is very important in in nature and climate change, it also signifies healing and health for sustainable development.
  * #ffffff: it signify purity and pristine.
  * RGBA(255,36,0, 0.8): It is a shade of red for cheerfulness, energy, and enthusiasm for the future and hope those for that need support.
  * Goldenrod this is a shade of golden-yellow, it signifies the worthiness.
  * rgba(0, 73, 83, 0.9): It is Sherpa Blue, it signifies the sky and the sea.
  * #777777: It is form of dark gray.
  * #FFBB89: It is Orange-like color which signifies creativity and vitality
  * rgba(195, 212, 37, 0.8)


 ## Content Section

For the game section, the cards will be layed out in a 4 by 4 grid for all devices. User will start by clicking on the slightly dark transparent overlay. Once started the user will hear the music background and clock will be starts counting down. The game title will be at the top.  The cards will flip on clicking and players will have to match pairs. If they are wrong cards flip back and the player continues. When the cards matches, that is, the center images at the card's front, it will sway in a dancing animation and remained cardfront, flipped.  If the user can't complete the game before the time runs out, there will be a Game over message accompanied with some melancholic sound for losing. In addition there will be a click to restart message on the screen so that the user can click again on the screen to try again. If all the cards matched, the user will get a Winner message on the screen and click to restart mesage, also there will an upbeat victory sound. The overall objective, is to get user engaged.


## Content Section

  **Wireframe**

The original website started by making sketches on paper, a rough work of what was intended to be created.  As the idea became clearer, the knowledge was transferred to [Balsamiq App](https://balsamiq.com/)for the design architechture and  the site wireframe was designed. Although, there were some minor changes in the design but mostly the layout on the app gave the guidance, a step by step guard to build the final website. Below is the link to the wireframe for the desktop and mobile devices.

# TESTING

***Sites Validation***

I used the following webistes to validate the site HTML, CSS, and Javascript files respectively.

* [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"): It validated the codes without any errors, view attached image here [HTML test](assets/testing/homepagehtml.png) and for the Game section  [HTML test](assets/testing/cardgamehtml.png).

* [CSS-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input"): It checked the Styling, without any errors, view attcahed image here [CSS test](assets/testing/homepagecss.png) and for the GAME section [CSS test](assets/testing/cardcss.png).

* [Jshint](https://jshint.com/): When using the tool about 15 warnings were flagged, the warnings have to do basicallly with the 'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6'). But I am sure confortable with it and the code is working perfectly,  however, I have taken note of that for next project. Also, there was another alert of one unused variable at the bottom. The variable was actually used and called in the home page section to control the a "Read More" button. However, all the codes work perfectly. Below are the two images.
[Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint1.png) and [Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint15.png).

* Chrome DevTools
        [Javascript test](assets/testing/devToolz.png)
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/gamemobilLit.png)
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/lighthouse2.png)
     
* [Lighthouse Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse): Performance, and accessibility test was conducted using the lighthouse tool option on chrome developer tool and generating a report for the selected device, to ensure the suitability and maximum performance for users. The first image was Intially generated for desktop view.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthousetest1.png">

The results above is 88%, after further cleaning and editing of the codes such removal of used codes and properly nestling some divs, the second image was generated which is 91% performance, though the developer strive for 100% which could be obtainable at the moment but hope to achive in future project. Below is the second image generated.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthouse2.png">


The results for mobile is 90%, although it is not terrible such a score but would strive to improve the score where needed to enhance it future performance. Below is the image from the mobile view.

### *Active Game Mode and back of cards*

* The active view of the game has the game Title, Timer, flip counter, cards and background sound. Below is an image.
* The card images enlarge when player or user hovers over the back of the cards, it animates and grows toward the center of the card.
* The five images at the back of the card represent items which are very significant to climate change.
* In the following order: Top-Left-Right, Bottom-Right-Left and center, the images are Carbondioxide molecule (Co2), Nitrous oxide molecule N2O, methane molecule (CH4), chloroflourocarbon molecule (CFC) and image of the earth.
* Those images except that of the earth are gases that causes green-house-gas (GHG), which are the major anthropogenic factors that cause climate change
* All the images rotate clockwisely.

### *Front of cards*
 * When a user clicks on a card, it flips over and the cardfront view is displayed.
 * In the following order: Top-Left-Right, Bottom-Right-Left and center, the images are flood, desert, wildfire, emssions and lastly are the win-value images to be matched in the center and they are person cycling, vertical city, smartcity, urban farming, solar panel, windturbine, recycling, and tree planting.
* Those images except the ones at the center are the likely impact of climate change, while the ones in center are the likely mitigation and adaptation means to climate change.
* The card images enlarge when player or user hovers over the front of the cards, it animates and grows toward the center of the card.

* When a user clicks, the flip sound could be heard.
* When a pair of cards matches on clicks, the cards will sway left to right in dancing animation and a clapping sounds and the matched cards remained face front.

## Bugs and resolves

1. **Naviagational bar**
    * In the game section, the Naviagational bar overlaps the Timer and the flipper due to the height of the game container both on desktop and in mobile view.
    * In addition, in the mobile view of the game, the logo overlaps the timer and flip counter.

 ### Resolve
 * The issues was resolved by making the colour and footer of the game section transparent, also by changing the styling from justify-content-center to  justify-content: space-between;.
 * Lastly, on the mobile device the logo was hidden.

1. **Responsiveness**

* Intially, the following problems were identified
  <img src="assets/testing/mobileunfit.png">

 * The 2 layout columns was not just good for the mobile view, it was not user-friendly, that was way code was initially built.
 length of card was just too long for media of 600px and below.

 ### Resolve

* The problem was resolve by applying media query of max-width 600px, and changing the layout into 4 columns.
* The method worked for all the small mobile devices except Iphone 5 series. Again, I had to apply another media query of max-width 350px. That resolve problems of Responsiveness and compactibility.
see here for the images [media@600](assets/testing/responsivecode2.png), and [media@600](assets/testing/responsivecode.png)

2. **Floating footer**

   * There was the footer problem that would not stick to the bottom. After doing lot of research by googling, and watching lot of youtube videos, finally there was solution after an interactive section with an online tutor.
    <img src="assets/testing/footerfloat.png">

### Resolve

 * It was because I hard coded the footer height. I had to remove the height value for it to be resolve

3. **Toggle Issue**

    * There was an issue of a button that has to be toggle twice before it reponded. The button was the Read More button in the centre of the jumbotron in the homepage. 
    * the major problem was because  <button class="btn btn-lg btn--cta btn--red hvr-grow-shadow read-moreButton expandToggle" onclick="readMore()">Read More..</button> the expandToggle class was used and also, in the Javascript the style was displayed none instead of block as can be seen in code below.
    {(var showContent = document.getElementById("showMoreContent1"); if (showContent.style.display === "none") )}

    <img src="assets/testing/footerfloat1.png">

### Resolve 
* The class expandToggle was removed and the style-display was changed from none to block.


4. **Card White Background**
One bug that was lastly resolved was on the game's card background. When the cards flip, its background is white. the card is not supposed to have a white background when it flips, although when card flips completely , the white background does not show. I did lot of researches on it and almost gave up on it until the solution finaly. 

<img src="assets/testing/whitebkg.png">

### Resolve 
* The simple solution is to set the cards' class background to transparent. [.card{ background-color: transparent; border-color: transparent;} ]
